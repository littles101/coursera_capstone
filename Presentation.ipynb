    "I currently live in a neighborhood that I really like. If I have to move to a new city, I want to find a similar neighborhood. In this project I am writing a program that will evaluate Neighborhoods close to a user-defined destination and compares them to an (also user-defined) reference neighborhood. The scope of the project is limited to Germany.\n",
